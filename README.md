## Introduction to APIs

APIs serve as a bridge between different software applications, allowing them to communicate and share data. This section provides an overview of API concepts, types (e.g., RESTful APIs), and their importance in modern software development.

## Getting Started


## API Development with Flask

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a lightweight web framework for Python. Learn how to create a simple API using Flask, define routes, and handle requests and responses.

## RESTful API Principles

Understand the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer) and design RESTful APIs. Explore concepts such as resources, HTTP methods, and status codes.

## Consuming APIs

Learn how to consume APIs using various programming languages. Understand the basics of making HTTP requests, handling responses, and parsing data.

## Authentication and Authorization

Explore authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth) to secure your API. Implement authorization to control access to different parts of your API.

## Error Handling

Handle errors gracefully in your API responses. Define meaningful error messages and status codes to aid developers consuming your API.

## Testing APIs

Implement testing strategies for your APIs, covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Use tools like Postman or Swagger for API testing and documentation.

## Project Examples

Apply your API development and integration skills to real-world projects:

1. **Task Management API:** Create an API for managing tasks with CRUD operations.
2. **Weather API Integration:** Integrate a weather API to fetch and display real-time weather data.
